# Advanced Shell Scripting

## Tasks

1. ### API Request Automation

 
Automate the process of making API requests to the Pokémon API and saving the results to a file

Instructions:

Write a shell script that makes a request to the Pokémon API (https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/ ) and retrieves data for a specific Pokémon Pikachu.

It should save the response to a json file: data.json

If the request fails, it should log the error to an error file: errors.txt

1.  ### Extract Pokémon Data

 
Use advanced text manipulation tools (jq, awk, sed) to extract specific data from the API response.

Instructions:

Write a script that extracts the Pokémon’s name, height, weight, and type from the JSON file created in Task 0.

Format the output in a human-readable way,“Pikachu is of type Electric, weighs 6kg, and is 0.4m tall.”

You should only use these commands: jq, awk, sed

2.  ### Batch Pokémon Data Retrieval

 
Automate the retrieval of data for multiple Pokémon and store it in separate files.

Instructions:

Create a script that loops through a list of Pokémon [Bulbasaur, Ivysaur, Venusaur, Charmander, Charmeleon.]

For each Pokémon, retrieve its data from the API and save it to a separate file named after the Pokémon (e.g., pikachu.json, bulbasaur.json…).

Handle any potential rate-limiting issues by adding a delay between requests.

3.  ### Summarize Pokémon Data

 
Create a report that summarizes data for multiple Pokémon.

Instructions:

Write a shell script that reads all the JSON files generated in Task 3 and extracts the name, height, and weight of each Pokémon.

Generate a CSV file containing the Pokémon’s name, height, and weight.

Use awk to calculate the average height and weight of all Pokémon in the report.

4.  ### Error Handling and Retry Logic

 
Add robust error handling and retry logic for API requests.

Instructions:

Modify the script from Task 2 to handle potential errors (e.g., network issues, invalid Pokémon names).

If an API request fails, implement a retry mechanism that attempts the request up to 3 times before logging the error and skipping to the next Pokémon.

5.  ### Parallel Data Fetching

 
Speed up data retrieval using parallel processing.

Instructions:

Write a script that fetches data for these Pokémon[ ] in parallel by leveraging background processes and process management tools.

Ensure that the script handles background processes properly and waits for all processes to complete before moving to the next step.
